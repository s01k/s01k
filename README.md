# Who Am I ?

* 😃 I have been given a name - "Souvik Santra". 

* 😋 I proudly call my self a web developer (irrespective of what others think)

* 😎 I am also a (not so) proud programmer, UI/UX designer (coz, who doesn't brag about extra skills?)

* 🤓 Do visit my [PORTFOLIO](https://s01k.github.io) (wrote about myself in a formal way, which the society accepts)

* 🙃 Last but not least, you MUST VISIT my [WEBSITE](https://souviksantra.netlify.app), or else I may steal your computer.
